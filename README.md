**Aims** What can we discover about New York City real estate market by using a years worth of transactions? Are there any spatial patterns that can be extracted from the data? Can we build a machine learning model that predicts sale value for unseen data points?

This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.
